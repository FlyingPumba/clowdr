# Contributing

## Code style

- All committed code should be auto-formatted. We have Prettier and ESLint rules set up, so make sure your IDE understands these.

## Commit style

- When making a commit that changes the database (i.e. it will require other developers to run a Hasura migration), prepend your commit message with the 'card file box' emoji.
  - It looks like this: ðŸ—ƒ
  - You can easily type it on Windows by pressing `Win + .` and typing `card f, Return`
